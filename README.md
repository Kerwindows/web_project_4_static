**Intro**

This is a project that showcases places around the U.S. We've made it so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. This is the 4th project of the Web Development program at Practicum by Yandex. It was created using HTML CSS and JavaScript, based on a figma draft.

**Main Requirements**

Layout

- The website appearance corresponds with the design.
- The BEM file structure is used.
- The design is responsive: the width of the content area must change depending on the width of the browser window. There shouldn't be any horizontal scrolling. Minimum window width is 320px (one card in a row). Maximum window width is 1280px (three cards in a row, 880px for the content and 200px of empty space on each side). If your browser window is wider than that, the content area should not get any wider.
- The page has six photo cards.

"Edit profile" Popup Box
- Code the "Edit profile" popup box. Make sure it has two fields titled "Name" and "About me" as well as a "Save" button.

- Give it fixed positioning, align it to the center of the page, and make the background for it semi-transparent and black. Code the semi-transparent background in the separate popup block. Place the box with the popup__container form inside this block, positioning it in the center.
By default, the user shouldn't see the popup box (display: none). Add the popup_opened modifier with a single rule to the popup box so that it can be opened. The rule must change the display property's value to block or flex. To close the popup box, remove the popup_opened modifier from it.

**Technologies**

HTML, CSS Flexbox and Grid Layout Responsive Design with JavaScript.
